# Minesweeper

A recreation of the Windows 95/98/ME Minesweeper written in Python.

### Rules and Instructions

Click on a square to reveal a portion of the minefield. Some revealed squares will have a number in them, this number represents the number of mines that the 8 surrounding squares contains. Use these numbers to judge where the mines are. If you click on a square that contains a mine, you lose. You can place a flag to mark a square as a mine by right-clicking. Flagged squares do not open when clicked, so you can use this to prevent yourself from accidentally clicking on a square that you already know is a mine. Right-clicking a second time will change the flag to a question mark, which do open when clicked. Right-clicking a third time turns the square empty again. Open all non-mine squares to win the game.

You can change the size of the board by choosing a different difficulty option in the "Game" option of the application menu. You can also set a custom board size by choosing the "Custom" option. After winning or losing a game, restart the game by either clicking the yellow face button, pressing F2, or clicking "Game" -> "New" in the application menu.
